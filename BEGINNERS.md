## Introduction

### What is Elasticsearch ?

Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library, that provides a full-text search engine with HTTP web
interfaces.

### How is it different from PostgreSQL ?

Unlike relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL, Elasticsearch does not store data in forms of columns located in
multiple tables.

Since Elasticsearch is a distributed system, it can handle incredibly large volumes of data without facing performance
issues. :boom:

Below are some key differences.

|                        | PostgreSQL | Elasticsearch |
|------------------------|------------|---------------|
| Type                   | RDBMS      | NoSQL         |
| Transaction support    | Yes        | No            |
| User authentication    | Yes        | No            |
| Consistency            | Yes        | No            |
| Availability           | Yes        | Yes           |
| Partition              | No         | Yes           |
| Near real time search  | No         | Yes           |

### What are indices and documents ?

> <span style="color:#0277CD"><b>An index is a collection of documents, and each document is a collection of fields.
> ES has the ability to be schema-less, meaning you don't need to how to handle the field of a document.</b></span>

In short, Elasticsearch stores JSON documents in indices, whereas PostgreSQL stores data in rows and columns across
tables in databases.

### Nodes

As mentioned above, Elasticsearch is a distributed system.
Meaning Elasticsearch can be a cluster of nodes, allowing you to deploy additional nodes that will be
capable of indexing and searching documents.

> <span style="color:#0277CD"><b>A node is a server that is part of a cluster.</b></span>

Elasticsearch automatically distributes the load across the available nodes.

There are two types of nodes.

- Master nodes, responsible for managing a cluster's activity.
- Data nodes, responsible for data indexing and search.

### Shards

As we mentioned above, Elasticsearch stores data in indices.
Those indices are fragmented into smaller units called shards.

> <span style="color:#8AC10E"><b>TIP: Avoid very large shards to avoid failure recover issues. A shard of 50GB is often

### Elasticsearch features and REST API

Elasticsearch provides with a REST API that can be called directly to access ES features.
You will find a complete API
documentation [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html)

## Creating, updating and deleting documents

### Indexing a new document

Let's imagine a car rental system where I want to store a car in an index named "vehicles".\
To do so, I can send the following request to Elasticsearch (available on port 9200 of your localhost).

Note that I don't need to create the index prior to creating a new car. Elasticsearch will automatically create the
index if it does not exist.

```
POST /vehicles/_doc
{
    "type": "car",
    "model": "prius",
    "license_plate": "STARLORD",
    "color": "white",
    "brand": "Toyota"
}
```

The answer should look something like that:

```json
{
  "_index": "vehicles",
  "_id": "9-eUnYIBzqjOGIvCpnMF",
  "_version": 1,
  "result": "created",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 7,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```

We can verify that the car was added by sending the following request.

```
POST /vehicles/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    }
}
```

The answer should look something like that:

```json
{
  "took": 0,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 1,
    "successful": 1,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 1,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 1.0,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "vehicules",
        "_id": "-eeVnYIBzqjOGIvCpHOt",
        "_score": 1.0,
        "_source": {
          "type": "car",
          "model": "prius",
          "license_plate": "STARLORD",
          "color": "white",
          "brand": "Toyota"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Of course, sending request like we just did would be extremely tedious in a real life project.\
Thankfully there are libraries available that will make it easier for a developer.\
In Python, we use the library elasticsearch available on PyPi (installed by Poetry at the beginning of the
tutorial).

We first need an instance of an Elasticsearch client:

```python
import elasticsearch as es

# Remember that this is a tutorial only and that an actual project
# would require ssl certification among other things.
es_client = es.Elasticsearch(
    hosts=[
        {
            "host": "localhost",
            "port": 9200,
        }
    ],
    connection_class=es.RequestsHttpConnection,
    timeout=60,
    max_retries=10,
    retry_on_timeout=True,
    ca_certs=False, verify_certs=False
)
es_client.index(
    index="vehicles",
    body={
        "type": "car",
        "model": "mustang",
        "license_plate": "IRONMAN",
        "color": "white",
        "brand": "Ford"
    }
)
```

Retrieving the document right after indexing will result in an empty result.

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
es_client.search(
    index="vehicles",
    body={
        "query": {"match": {"license_plate": "IRONMAN"}}
    }
)
```

```json
{
  "_shards": {
    "failed": 0,
    "skipped": 0,
    "successful": 1,
    "total": 1
  },
  "hits": {
    "hits": [],
    "max_score": null,
    "total": {
      "relation": "eq",
      "value": 0
    }
  },
  "timed_out": null,
  "took": 0
}
```

> <span style="color:#0277CD"><b>The reason for this is that although indexing is near real time, indices are refreshed
> by default every 1 second.</b></span>

You can force a refresh to update the index at the time of the request:

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
es_client.index(
    index="vehicles",
    body={
        "type": "car",
        "model": "mustang",
        "license_plate": "IRONMAN",
        "color": "white",
        "brand": "Ford"
    },
    refresh=True,
)
```

You will also notice that Elasticsearch has automatically created an ID for the said document. Although convenient, it
might
be an issue when we want to update the document.
That's why providing an ID when indexing a new document is sometimes preferable,
especially if you are indexing entities from your system.

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
es_client.index(
    index="vehicles",
    id=1,
    body={
        "type": "car",
        "model": "mustang",
        "license_plate": "IRONMAN",
        "color": "white",
        "brand": "Ford"
    }
)
```

### Updating a document

As mentioned above, updating a document will require an ID

```
POST /vehicles/_doc/1
{
    "color": "red",
}
```

The answer should look something like that:

```json
{
  "_index": "vehicles",
  "_id": "1",
  "_version": 2,
  "result": "updated",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 3,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```

Using the Python Elasticsearch update() method will look like this:

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
es_client.update(
    index="vehicles",
    id="1",
    body={
        "doc": {"color": "red"}
    },
)
```

### Deleting a document

To delete a document using the Elasticsearch API, I can send the following request.

```
DELETE /vehicles/_doc/1
```

The answer should look something like that:

```json
{
  "_index": "vehicles",
  "_id": "1",
  "_version": 2,
  "result": "deleted",
  "_shards": {
    "total": 2,
    "successful": 1,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "_seq_no": 1,
  "_primary_term": 1
}
```

Using Python Elasticsearch delete() method will look like this:

```python
# noinspection PyUnresolvedReferences
es_client.delete(
    index="vehicles",
    id="6c5a3e96-b9f4-4a08-ad5d-ad1fa0791d1b",
)
```

You can exercise with indexing documents [here](tests/test_index.py)

## Searching for documents

### Using a Match query

There are many ways to retrieve documents in Elasticsearch. One of them is to use a Match query.
The Match query will look for documents with fields matching the query:

```
GET /vehicles/_search

{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "license_plate": {
        "query": "STARLORD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Note that specifying an index is not mandatory.

The query could be sent this way as well:

```
GET /vehicles/_search

{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "license_plate": "STARLORD"
    }
  }
}
```
